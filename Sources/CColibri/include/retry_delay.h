/**
 * Feeds a successful request outcome back into the learner.
 *
 * The new target base is derived from `retry_count` as follows:
 *
 * - `retry_count == 0` or `retry_count == 1`: the server was ready within
 *   `base` ms. Both outcomes give only an upper bound on the warm-up time
 *   (`T_warm <= base`), so we use the midpoint `base/2` as the target and
 *   let the slow downward gain (`DOWN_SHIFT`) probe carefully. Once the
 *   base drifts too low we will see an `R == 2` and jump back up.
 * - `retry_count >= 2`: the warm-up time fell into
 *   `(base * (2^(R-1) - 1), base * (2^R - 1)]`. We target the upper bound
 *   so the next attempt is again likely to hit `R == 1`, from which we can
 *   probe down again.
 *
 * Adaptation is intentionally asymmetric: it reacts fast when more delay is
 * needed (so a slow node converges quickly, `UP_SHIFT` half the gap) and
 * probes downward slowly (`DOWN_SHIFT` an eighth of the gap, to avoid
 * gradually drifting into an extra retry per request). The new base is
 * clamped to `[C4_RETRY_DELAY_MIN_MS, C4_RETRY_DELAY_MAX_MS]` and persisted
 * via the storage plugin when one is registered.
 *
 * Only call this from a code path where the same-node retry loop for the
 * given category was active (e.g. for `C4_RETRY_CATEGORY_OBLIVIOUS`, only
 * when the request was routed to an oblivious node). Otherwise the learner
 * would be polluted by unrelated traffic.
 *
 * @param category    Same string previously passed to `c4_retry_delay_for`
 * @param chain       Chain identifier
 * @param retry_count Number of delayed retries that were performed before
 *                    the request finally succeeded
